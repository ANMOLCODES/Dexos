# Dexos

A webapp that acts as an playground for new comers into blockchain. They can get accustomed to using applications like Dexs without the anxiety of losing their money or making wrong transactions. 

# Problem Statement

Being in Web3 for about a year, transacting with real money has been a fear that has been prevalent within me and my peers, accidentally sending more tokens than required, transacting to a wrong wallet address or swapping the wrong token on DEXâ€™s like Uniswap is scary due to the amount of risk involved. This hinders the onboarding of web2 users to the revolutionary technology that is web3.
